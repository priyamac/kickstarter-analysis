## Overview of Project 

This project looks at the outcomes of 4114 fundraising campaigns, and how they fared in relations to their launch dates and finding goals. The fundraising campaign data was collected from 2009 to 2017, across 21 countries and a range of sectors, but the project will be looking particularly at the theatre industry. 

This paper will provide a brief analysis of the outcomes of fundraising campaigns based off of their launch dates, as well as their target goals, as well as provide a brief conclusion about the findings. In addition, it will go over some of the challenges and limitations of working with this dataset, and provide some additional findings which may be useful in this analysis. 


## Purpose 

The aim of this paper is to determine whether fundraising campaigns, in particular those within the theatre industry, were successful at hitting their funding goals. It aims to determine the ideal amount a campaign should set their fundraising goal, and when to launch their campaigns, in order to achieve a successful outcome.

## Analysis and Challenges 

This part of the project provides a brief explantion of how and why the data was analysed, as well as some challenges faced when reviewing the data.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

One way the outcomes can be looked at is by launch date. The data can be filtered to view how many campaigns were either success, failed, or were cancelled by month, to see if there’s a trend in fundraising outcomes over the course of a year.

- **Creating Pivot Tables**

A pivot table provides a helpful summary which is easy to analyse, that is proven useful for of a large amount of data. To look at outcomes based on launch dates;

      - ‘Insert’
      - ‘Pivot Table’
      - Select dataset 
      - Chose to place it in ‘New worksheet’

To look at outcomes based on launch dates, the table needs to be filtered by outcomes and month, with outcomes being the value that’s being measured (see fields below).

<sup>*note that ‘Years’ and ‘Quarters’ need to be removed from ‘Rows’, to display by month.

## Results

#### Conclusions about the Outcomes based on Launch Date

The first way the outcomes can be looked at is by launch date. The data can be filtered to view how many campaigns were either success, failed, or were cancelled, by month. The graph below plots the outcomes of all the campaigns and another one for the campaigns in only the theatre industry.
